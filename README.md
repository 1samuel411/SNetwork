# SNetwork

## What is this?

SNetwork is a little project I made to play with Sockets and Unity. It's a very robust little project that features data syncing, servers, networked methods, and some more!

## Why did I stop?

It would take SO much effort to beat what Unity and Photon has accomplished with their networking systems thus I stopped however I do think I know how I would implement features seen in Photon and UNet given time.

## How to use it?

Open the Project in Unity. To export the Server click on Tools/SNetwork/Create Server and configure the export. Currently a windows standalone is the only supported export type. Clients can now connect to the server once the server is configured and opened.
